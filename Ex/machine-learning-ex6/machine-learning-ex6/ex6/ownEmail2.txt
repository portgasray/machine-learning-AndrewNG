> Is there a Limitless Audiobook?!
>
Hi, Kwik Brain.

Since my book released last month, the question we get repeatedly goes something like this...

"Jim, do you have an audio version of Limitless?!"

So if you're on the go and find audiobooks valuable, then we have great news!

Limitless is available TODAY on AUDIBLE, and we couldn't be more excited.

Start listening to your audiobook now <=

When you order the audiobook today, and you will gain access to our live 4-week Limitless Book Club starting on Wednesday, June 3rd!

Make sure you submit your receipt here at LimitlessBook.com to get access.

Get in touch with your reading!

The audiobook is fantastic to listen to, but we tend to learn more actively with physical books. A lot of people can listen passively, but reading requires you to engage your whole brain.

You can also participate in all the written exercises and use it as was designed - an owner's manual for your mind. If you haven't gotten your copy yet, grab one today.

Let's get Limitless!


Your brain coach,

Jim Kwik

P.S. â€“ If you have a copy of Limitless and find it valuable, would you please leave a quick & honest review on Amazon (or wherever you got it?) Your words are important and will inspire others to learn & live without limits. Thank you!
